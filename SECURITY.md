# Security Policy

## Tributary AI services for DeepLake Security

The Tributary AI services for DeepLake takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üîí Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Support**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure API key generation and validation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions (read, write, admin)
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Secure tenant separation and resource isolation

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation using Pydantic
- **Error Sanitization**: Secure error responses that don't leak sensitive information
- **Secure Defaults**: All security-sensitive configuration requires explicit setup

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Secure separation of configuration from code
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials must be provided via environment variables
- **Docker Security**: Secure containerized deployment with minimal attack surface

## üîß Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# JWT Secret (Required) - Must be at least 32 characters
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")

# API Keys - Generate using provided tools
python scripts/generate_api_key_quick.py
```

### Security Best Practices
1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for all credentials**
3. **Rotate API keys regularly**
4. **Use strong, unique JWT secrets**
5. **Enable HTTPS in production**
6. **Configure proper firewall rules**

## üö® Security Updates

### v1.0.1 Security Hardening
- **BREAKING**: Removed hardcoded API key `dev-12345-abcdef-67890-ghijkl`
- **BREAKING**: JWT_SECRET_KEY now required via environment variable
- **Added**: Secure API key generation tools
- **Added**: Comprehensive environment variable validation

2. **Version**: Include the version number or git commit
3. **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
4. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
5. **Steps**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
6. **Proof of Concept**: Code or logs demonstrating the issue (if applicable)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and provide an initial response within 1 week
- **Fix**: We will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing
- **Credit**: We will credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## üîê Security Vulnerability Response

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Security Release**: As soon as possible after fix validation

### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Immediate fix required, emergency release
- **High**: Fix within 1-2 weeks, priority release
- **Medium**: Fix within 1 month, next regular release
- **Low**: Fix when convenient, documentation update
