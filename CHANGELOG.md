- **Hybrid Search**: Combined vector and text search with multiple fusion algorithms (RRF, Linear, Weighted Harmonic Mean)
- **Text Search**: Full-text search implementation with BM25 ranking and language-aware processing
- **HNSW Vector Indexing**: High-performance approximate nearest neighbor search with automatic index building
- **Advanced Metadata Filtering**: Complex filter expressions supporting nested fields and logical operators
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tenant rate limiting with sliding window, token bucket, fixed window, and leaky bucket strategies
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Automated backup scheduling with S3 and local storage support
- **Import/Export**: Bulk data operations supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics collection with golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration with Jaeger for end-to-end request tracing
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs for request tracking
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-built dashboards for operations, performance, and business metrics
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Multi-level alerts with AlertManager supporting email, Slack, and PagerDuty

## [1.0.1] - 2025-07-16

### Security
- **BREAKING**: Removed hardcoded API keys from examples and scripts
  - Eliminated hardcoded development API key `dev-12345-abcdef-67890-ghijkl`
  - Updated all example scripts to use environment variables
  - Added API key generation scripts for secure key creation
- **BREAKING**: Replaced hardcoded JWT secret with environment variable requirement
  - JWT_SECRET_KEY now required via environment variable
  - Service will not start without proper JWT_SECRET_KEY configuration
  - Added validation to ensure JWT secret is at least 32 characters

### Added
- **API Documentation**: Documentation endpoints now always available
  - `/docs` (Swagger UI) accessible in all environments
  - `/redoc` (ReDoc) accessible in all environments
  - Removed debug-only restriction on documentation endpoints
- **Configuration Management**: Enhanced environment variable handling
  - Added comprehensive `.env` file support for uv run
  - Improved Pydantic settings schema for better validation
  - Added support for nested configuration classes
- **Security Tools**: API key generation and management
  - `generate_api_key_quick.py` - Non-interactive API key generator
  - `bashrc_exports.sh` - Environment variable configuration template
  - Secure key generation using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`

### Changed
- **Service Startup**: Fixed uv run compatibility
  - Corrected AuthConfig environment variable mapping
  - Simplified .env file to match settings schema
  - Added `extra = "ignore"` to Settings class for flexibility
- **Documentation**: Updated all examples to use environment variables
  - cURL examples now reference `$API_KEY` environment variable
  - Python client examples use environment-based configuration
  - Docker and deployment examples updated with secure practices

### Fixed
- **Authentication**: Resolved Pydantic validation errors
  - Fixed JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable loading
  - Corrected nested configuration class initialization
  - Resolved service startup issues with `uv run`
- **Documentation Access**: API documentation now properly accessible
  - Fixed conditional logic that prevented docs access
  - Documentation endpoints work regardless of debug mode
  - Improved root endpoint to display documentation URLs

### Removed
- **Security Risk**: Eliminated all hardcoded credentials
  - Removed hardcoded API key `dev-12345-abcdef-67890-ghijkl`
  - Removed hardcoded JWT secret from configuration
  - Cleaned up test files to use environment variables only
